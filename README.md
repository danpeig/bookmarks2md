# Browser bookmarks to markdown converter

This free tool converts the bookmarks HTML file exported from browsers (Chrome, Firefox and others) to Markdown (md) format.

It runs from a plain HTML file: no installation, no extensions, no command line, no permissions. Just the same browser you used to export the bookmarks backup.

If you would like to implement the import feature into another program or code, you can find the commented JavaScript code inside the index.hml source file.

The tool is not working as expected? Contact the developer <a href="https://www.danbp.org">Daniel Brooke Peig</a>.
