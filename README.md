# Browser bookmarks to markdown converter

This free tool converts exported bookmarks from web browsers to Markdown (md) format.

It runs from a plain HTML file: no installation, no extensions, no python, no command line, no permissions. Use the same browser you used to create the backup.

Currently it supports inputs in the HTML format.

## Instructions
1. From your browser, export bookmarks in the HTML format (menu "Manage bookmarks"->"Export")
2. Open the tool - [optional online version](https://www.danbp.org/bookmarks2md.html), [optional GitHub hosted version](https://danpeig.github.io/bookmarks2md/bookmarks2md.html)
3. Select the HTML files (up to 16 files).
4. Click "Convert"
5. Check the outputs.
6. Copy to clipboard or download the md file.

## Online version
If you don't want to download any file, there is an [online version here](https://www.danbp.org/bookmarks2md.html) or [directly from GitHub](https://danpeig.github.io/bookmarks2md/bookmarks2md.html).

## Developers
If you would like to implement the conversion engine into another program or code, you can find the commented JavaScript code inside the index.hml source file. Please note that it requires a DOM object holding the contents of the HTML file.
